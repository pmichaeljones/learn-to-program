#define method that takes an array as an argument

#In an effort to find the solution, I like to write out the English wording.

#I will first find the index lenth of the array

#Using RAND I will select 1 object from the array passed on random index

#I'll then push this random selection onto a new array

#Ill repeat the process until the original array's length == 0
